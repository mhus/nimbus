# nimbus

Nimbus is a set of java services to
run an MMORPG game server.

The main goal of this project is to
generate content full from AI.

The system is designed to be modular and
extremely scalable.

There are many planets, and each planet is a
separate world and cna be handled by a separate
server. The lookup service is used to find the
server for a given planet.
